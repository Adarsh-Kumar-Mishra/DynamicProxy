In Java, a dynamic proxy is a powerful feature that allows you to create proxy instances of interfaces at runtime.It's part of the java.lang.reflect package and is commonly used in frameworks like Spring and Hibernate for things like AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), logging, and transaction management.

ðŸ§  What It Does

A dynamic proxy intercepts method calls on an interface and routes them through a handler, giving you control over what happens when a method is invoked.

ðŸ”§ Key Components

Interface: You must have an interface to proxy.

InvocationHandler: This is where you define what happens when a method is called.

Proxy.newProxyInstance(): This method creates the proxy instance.
